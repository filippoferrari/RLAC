# Data
- `data_anx_gad7_prior.csv` contains the individual demographic and fitted parameters for the data split according to a GAD-7 score median split of the data.
- `data_single_prior.csv` contains the individual demographic and fitted parameters for the data fitted using a single prior encompassing all participants.
- `hbayesdm_data` contains the individual choice data processed to be used by hBayesDm. 


# JASP
The JASP file contains the entire statistical analysis reported in the paper.


# R
